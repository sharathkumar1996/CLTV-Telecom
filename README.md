## **Project Overview**

Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) is a crucial metric that measures the total revenue a customer is expected to generate during their relationship with a company. CLTV is an important metric for telecom companies because it helps them understand the value of their customer base and make strategic decisions about customer acquisition and retention.

CLTV analysis enables companies to identify high-value customers, develop personalized retention strategies, and allocate marketing resources accordingly. It also helps companies optimize their sales and pricing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce churn rate.

It enables companies to identify high-value customers and focus their marketing and sales efforts on retaining these customers. This, in turn, leads to a reduction in customer churn rate and an increase in customer loyalty.
CLTV analysis helps companies optimize their pricing strategies by identifying which services are most valuable to customers. Companies can then adjust their pricing strategies accordingly to maximize revenue and profitability.
It also helps companies improve their overall customer satisfaction levels by identifying the factors that are most important to customers. Companies can then focus on improving these areas to ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty.

CLTV can be perceived differently for revenue, customer churn, loyalty and retention. Each approach provides a different perspective on customer value and helps companies understand the different factors that impact customer lifetime.

In this project, we will be exploring different CLTV calculation methods, and analyzing feature importance to determine the most influential factors on CLTV.
We will also be identifying high-value customers based on their CLTV scores, analyzing their characteristics and behavior, and providing suggestions for targeted marketing and retention strategies.
